# `Welcome to my site.`

This site is to document my code and help to better illustrate my repos. I'm a student studying computer science and engineering. My work is *mostly* documented though github and on these Markdown pages.

To check my repos go to [github.com/jamesaharris](github.com/jamesaharris). I am helping my friend [Garrett](github.com/GarrettRector) with some of his projects and showing [London](github.com/N52PLAYS) some of how python and other languages work.
